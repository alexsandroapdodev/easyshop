        <p id="ecommercedashboard">What is an E-commerce Dashboard?</p>
        <p>An E-commerce Dashboard is a visual panel that brings together, in real time, the main performance
            indicators of an online store. It serves as a command center, allowing managers and analysts to monitor
            sales, customer behavior, campaign performance and much more — all in a clear and centralized manner.</p>

    <section class="container-left">
        <p>The importance of Dashboard in e-commerce</p>
        <p>In the highly competitive e-commerce environment, making decisions based on data is essential. A
            dashboard facilitates this decision-making by presenting the most relevant information in real time,
            providing a clear and strategic view of the business. Without it, monitoring KPIs becomes scattered and
            less efficient.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="container-left">
        <p>How does it work?</p>
        <p>Dashboards collect data from different sources — such as sales platforms, analytics tools, ERPs, and CRMs
            — and transform it into easy-to-understand graphs, tables, and indicators. Most dashboards can be
            customized, allowing each company to track exactly what matters to its operations.</p>

        <p>Sales indicators</p>
        <p>One of the main focuses of any e-commerce dashboard is sales data. This includes order volume, total
            revenue, average ticket, best-selling products, and comparisons with previous periods. This data helps
            you understand the financial health of your business.</p>

    <section class="container-left">
        <p>Customer Behavior Metrics</p>
        <p>In addition to sales, it is essential to monitor how customers interact with your store. Metrics such as
            bounce rate, average time on page, pages per session, and navigation flow help you understand what
            attracts or repels consumers during their purchasing journey.</p>

    <section class="container-left">
        <p>Conversion Funnel Tracking</p>
        <p>The dashboard can also track the conversion funnel, from the initial visit to the final purchase. This
            helps identify bottlenecks in the customer journey and implement strategic improvements at the stages
            with the highest abandonment rate.</p>

        <p>Real-time inventory and logistics</p>
        <p>Some more complete dashboards also integrate inventory and logistics information. This allows you to
            monitor product availability, average shipping time, late deliveries, and even the return rate,
            optimizing supply chain management.</p>

        <p>Marketing campaign performance</p>
        <p>With the dashboard, you can track the results of email campaigns, social media, paid ads, and promotions.
            Metrics such as ROI, CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost), and conversions by channel help you understand
            which actions are bringing real results.</p>

        <p>Customization for different areas of the company</p>
        <p>The dashboard can be adapted to suit the internal audience: while the marketing team monitors traffic and
            engagement metrics, the finance team looks at profits and margins. This allows for more collaborative
            management focused on the objectives of each area.</p>
